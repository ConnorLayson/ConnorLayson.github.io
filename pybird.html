			<p>PyJay is a python library that makes development in Pygame easier. It acts like a game engine in the sense that you can define buttons, animations, maps, interactables, walls, particles, save files, and more</p>
			<p>PyJay is still under development and I am currently working on a PyBird 3D module and possibly PyJay Online.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The aim of PyJay is to make game development in Python and Pygame easier. I remember first starting out and spending a lot of time looking up how to make things like buttons and how to animate sprites. PyBird does this for you and helps you learn.</p>
