		<h3>WARNING: Rocket 260 is in a BETA build. Not much work is put into the site yet.</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Welcome! Rocket 260 is an app where you can draw rockets before you build the models. This calculates the Center of Gravity (COM) and Center of Pressure (CP) for you, as you add and remove parts.</p>
		<p>Save and load files to edit later, and build anywhere, as this app needs no internet connection.</p>
